## Idea Description

Learning has no age barriers.The early we start the more time we have to master a particular field of study.The same goes with mastering the art of writing codes.The early we start the better we are at it.But the major problem lies in the availaibility of resources i.e. bsically computers and laptops. A majority of the population does not have access to these facilities.But when compared to having laptops or computers it is quite easy to find smart phones among the majority.But life is not so easy when it comes to code on a smartphone.However it is much easy to write a code an paper than to write it on a smartphone but how to run and compile this handwritten code? Well every problem has a solution and so does this. The solution is that we code scan this code and then digitalise it and compile-run it on cloud.
Well this is basically the underlying idea **CodeOnPaper** .
